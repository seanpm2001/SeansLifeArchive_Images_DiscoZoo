# Rescue Conservation

To enhance my gameplay, I have an extra goal I put into animal rescues in Disco Zoo:

I try to destroy as little of the environment as possible when searching for animals, unless absolutely necessary.

The top priority is to save trees, and water (and also to destroy volcanoes) the lowest priority is to save structures and rocks.
