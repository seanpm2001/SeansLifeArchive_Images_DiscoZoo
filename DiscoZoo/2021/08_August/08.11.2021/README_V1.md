# Disco Zoo session August 11th 2021

<!-- I had a very short session today, only doing collection and waking up animals, then quitting. I didn't feel like playing today. !-->

I had a very, very long session today, spending nearly all my coins on rescues across various regions, and made significant progress on many space reQuests, threw 2 disco parties, and eventually quit. I played for nearly 2 hours today. - August 11th 2021
