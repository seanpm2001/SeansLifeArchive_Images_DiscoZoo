# Disco Zoo session August 4th 2021

<!-- I had a very short session today, only doing collection and waking up animals, then quitting. I didn't feel like playing today. !-->

I had a very long session today, spending nearly all my coins on Jurassic and Savannah rescues, and made significant progress in increasing my Jurassic Park. I saved up a few disco bux, and did a few space ReQuests, then wrapped up and quit.

## Overview
