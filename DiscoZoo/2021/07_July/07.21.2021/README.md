# Disco Zoo session July 21st 2021

I had a long session today, unlocking the time machine and doing several rescues in the Jurassic. I focused on rescuing as many animals as I could afford, and destroying volcanoes. I messed up on 1 rescue and didn't get a disco bux. I made significant progress today.

I was originally not going to play today and save up more, but I decided to play today.

<!-- I had a very short session today, only doing collection and waking up animals, then quitting. I am saving up for the time machine, which costs 300,000 coins. !-->

## Overview

See above.
