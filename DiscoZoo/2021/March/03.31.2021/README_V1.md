# Disco Zoo session March 31st 2021

I didn't play Disco Zoo for very long today, as I quickly ran out of retry ads. At least this will give me more money for more attempts in future sessions.

## Farm rescues

I rescued some animals from the farm, but gained no new animals. I only freed them today.

## Ad issues

The game had ad issues today, and I got less than 4 ad watch bonuses, so I quit early due to this.

## Extra info

My session was so short today, that I was also able to upload todays zip file as an extra.
