I played for nearly 1 hour today. I originally was not going to play at all. I failed on my goal of spending all my money before quitting, as I kept receiving more faster than I could spend it. - August 18th 2021

I had a very long session today, spending nearly all my coins on rescues across various regions, and made lots of progress in rescuing new Ice Age animals after unlocking the Ice Age time machine.

I had a very long session today, spending over 100,000 coins on rescues across various regions, and made lots of progress in rescuing new Ice Age animals after unlocking the Ice Age time machine last week. I also did some rescues in the Northern region, and completed a few Space ReQuests. I threw a disco party at the end to get all my animals up, as it was too difficult to maintain. - 2021 September 22nd

I had an extremely long session today, originally I wasn't going to play at all, other than to wake my animals up. Today, I did rescues across various regions to complete space requests. I also maxed out my first mythical animal (Grython) and along with it, maxed out the savannah. I dealt with a lot of annoying ads again today. I eventually stopped doing all ReQuests and did rescues for a bit, then went back and spent some of my final money on more Space ReQuests. I didn't spend all my money, as I had been playing too long and needed to quit. - 2021 September 29th

I had an extremely long session today, originally I wasn't going to play at all, other than to wake my animals up, just like last week. Today, I did rescues across various regions to complete many space requests. I threw several disco parties due to getting multiple bronze, silver, and gold trophies. I dealt with a lot of annoying ads again today. I didn't spend all my money, as I had been playing too long and needed to quit. I still had over 50000 coins when quitting, as it was almost 2:00 pm. The amount of images and its ratio file size gave me joy. - 2021 October 6th
