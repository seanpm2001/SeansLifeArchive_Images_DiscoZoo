# Disco Zoo session June 23rd 2021

I had a very long session today and played for nearly an hour. I originally decided that I was going to collect and quit, but I wanted to play today. I did rescues in various regions, did several quests, gathered loads of DiscoBux (ending with a total of 105, surpassing 100 today) did several space ReQuests, and spent nearly all funds before quitting, leaving about 2000+ coins to spare.
