# Disco Zoo session June 9th 2021

I had a very long session today and did a lot of rescues in the Jungle, along with some rescues on the moon. I spent over 150,000 coins, and played for about or more than an hour.

## Jungle

I have nearly maxed out every jungle animal. Rescues now cost 9000 coins each.

## Moon missions

I did a few moon missions, and some Space ReQuests.

## Disco

I threw a disco at the end of my session to wake my animals up. I also learned that the lighting of the disco is customizable.

## Overview

See above.
