# Disco Zoo session June 16th 2021

I had a very long session today and played for over an hour. I did rescues in various regions, did several quests, gathered loads of DiscoBux (ending with a total of 105, surpassing 100 today) did several space ReQuests, and sold 2 animals. I didn't spend all my funds before quitting, leaving about 20000+ coins to spare.
