# Disco Zoo session April 28th 2021

I had a very long session today and made lots of progress towards various aspects, although I failed on the "saving up to buy the Jungle region" goal, it will probably take 1-3 more weeks now of just saving.

## Savannah

I did a lot of rescues in the Savannah today, and got many animals pens to max level. This is where I was mainly today.

## Farm

I made minor progress on the farm today, and rescued some animals. This was done mostly to complete some space ReQuests, although I did bring a few new animals to my zoo.

## Outback

I made minor progress in the outback today, and rescued some animals. This was done mostly to complete some space ReQuests, although I did bring a few new animals to my zoo.

## Polar

I made very minimal progress in the Polar region today, mostly just to complete some space ReQuests.

## Space

I unlocked the outer space region today by getting over 600 animals in my zoo. I completed some space ReQuests today and rescued 4 different types of moon animals.

### Moon

I unlocked the moon today, as it is the first space region. I unlocked 4 different moon animals here, of which 2 habitats finished construction today, and the other 2 will be finished tomorrow, and will be ready by the time I play next week (Wednesday, May 5th 2021)

## Ads

I dealt with over a hundred ads today, and it was depressing, and frustrating. There is such poor moderation on mobile ads, it should be illegal.

## Disco bux

I earned several disco bux today, but missed out on 1 disco bux on a single moon mission, which I am disappointed in.

## Overview

See above.
