# Disco Zoo session

I had a long and laggy Disco Zoo session today (you likely won't see the lag, as I got pictures, not videos)

## Savannah

I rescued several animals from the Savannah today. Ads were working fine in the game today, so I could keep continuing without wasting Disco Bux

## Jungle

I am getting close to unlocking the jungle. I just need to rescue 4 more animals, and save up 200,000 coins.

## Overview

Todays session was long, but fun. I rescued many animals in the Savannah, did some quests, and got closer to unlocking the Jungle region.
