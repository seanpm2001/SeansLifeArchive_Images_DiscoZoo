# Disco Zoo session May 19th 2021

I had a long session today. I spent nearly all my coins rescuing animals in the Jungle today, so I can make progress and get closer to unlocking a time machine. I also decided to spend 1 discobux to start a disco to make all my animals fully awake before quitting, and to see what it was like. I am starting to consider making this game a daily game.

## Jungle

I unlocked the Jungle region today and rescued over 20 animals. I spent over 50000 coins doing rescues in the Jungle.

## Overview

See above.
