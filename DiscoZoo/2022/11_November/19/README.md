# 2022 November 19th - Didn't play

I didn't play Disco Zoo today. I took a break from it, as I didn't have the time. I wanted to play today, but I didn't have the time.

## Why?

Due to a discovery on Saturday, 2020 October 24th about how much time all games together take up, and how little time it leaves me, I had to make a schedule change for gaming, splitting all 25 games I play across a 7 day period, instead of all in 1 day.

## When will you come back?

I won't be playing this game again until the new time slot, which is Wednesday. I will be playing again on Wednesday, 2022, November 23rd.

Starting with a decision on 2022, Thursday, July 21st, I will no longer be uploading Git-image part A files to GitHub on a daily/weekly basis. I am making a transition. Images from 2022 July 27th and onward will not be uploaded here.

This decision was reversed on 2022, Wednesday, October 12th. Data began being uploaded again, and as of 2022, Wednesday, October 19th, the repository is back up to date.
