# Disco Zoo is closed source, and I don't know what language it is written in, so I chose the name of a programming language with the name of something that would typically be in a zoo (Python) as I couldn't figure out what else to make the official project language. I want this project to have a language assigned to it, so I wrote this file in Python.
